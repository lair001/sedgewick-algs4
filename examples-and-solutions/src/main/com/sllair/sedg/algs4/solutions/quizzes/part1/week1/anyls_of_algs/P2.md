Question Prompt:
Search in a bitonic array. An array is bitonic if it is comprised of an increasing sequence of integers followed
immediately by a decreasing sequence of integers. Write a program that, given a bitonic array of n distinct integer
values, determines whether a given integer is in the array.

Standard version: Use ∼3*lg(n) compares in the worst case.

Signing bonus: Use ∼ 2*lg(n) compares in the worst case (and prove that no algorithm can guarantee to perform fewer
than ∼2*lg(n) compares in the worst case).

Solution:
See my solution of Exercise 20 from Section 1.4 of the book.
