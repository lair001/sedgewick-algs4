Question Prompt:
Egg drop. Suppose that you have an nn-story building (with floors 1 through nn) and plenty of eggs. An egg breaks if
it is dropped from floor T or higher and does not break otherwise. Your goal is to devise a strategy to determine the
value of  T given the following limitations on the number of eggs and tosses:

+  Version 0: 1 egg, ≤T tosses.
+  Version 1: ∼1*lg(n) eggs and  ~1*lg(n) tosses.
+  Version 2: ∼lg(T) eggs and ∼2*lg(T) tosses.
+  Version 3: 2 eggs and  ∼2*sqrt(n) tosses.
+  Version 4: 2 eggs and  ≤c*sqrt(T) tosses for some fixed constant cc.

Solution:
See my solution for Exercise 24 from Section 1.4 of the book.
